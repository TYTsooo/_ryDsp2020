    "\n",
    "We’ll start with periodic signals, which are signals that repeat themselves after some period of time. For example, if you strike a bell, it vibrates and generates sound. If you record that sound and plot the transduced signal, it looks like Figure 1.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "This signal resembles a sinusoid, which means it has the same shape as the trigonometric sine function.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that this signal is periodic. I chose the duration to show three full repetitions, also known as cycles. The duration of each cycle, called the period, is about 2.3 ms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The frequency of a signal is the number of cycles per second, which is the inverse of the period. The units of frequency are cycles per second, or Hertz, abbreviated “Hz”. (Strictly speaking, the number of cycles is a dimensionless number, so a Hertz is really a “per second”).\n",
    "\n",
    "The frequency of this signal is about 439 Hz, slightly lower than 440 Hz, which is the standard tuning pitch for orchestral music. The musical name of this note is A, or more specifically, A4. If you are not familiar with “scientific pitch notation”, the numerical suffix indicates which octave the note is in. A4 is the A above middle C. A5 is one octave higher.

For example, Figure 1.2 shows a segment from a recording of a violin playing Boccherini’s String Quintet No. 5 in E, 3rd movement.\n",

    "Again we can see that the signal is periodic, but the shape of the signal is more complex. The shape of a periodic signal is called the waveform. Most musical instruments produce waveforms more complex than a sinusoid. The shape of the waveform determines the musical timbre, which is our perception of the quality of the sound. People usually perceive complex waveforms as rich, warm and more interesting than sinusoids.\n"

    "\n",
    "The most important topic in this book is spectral decomposition, which is the idea that any signal can be expressed as the sum of sinusoids with different frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important mathematical idea in this book is the Discrete Fourier Transform, or DFT, which takes a signal and produces its spectrum. The spectrum is the set of sinusoids that add up to produce the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the most important algorithm in this book is the Fast Fourier Transform, or FFT, which is an efficient way to compute the DFT.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Figure 1.3 shows the spectrum of the violin recording in Figure 1.2. The x-axis is the range of frequencies that make up the signal. The y-axis shows the strength or amplitude of each frequency component.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lowest frequency component is called the fundamental frequency. The fundamental frequency of this signal is near 440 Hz (actually a little lower, or “flat”).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this signal the fundamental frequency has the largest amplitude, so it is also the dominant frequency. Normally the perceived pitch of a sound is determined by the fundamental frequency, even if it is not dominant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other spikes in the spectrum are at frequencies 880, 1320, 1760, and 2200, which are integer multiples of the fundamental. These components are called harmonics because they are musically harmonious with the fundamental:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 880 is the frequency of A5, one octave higher than the fundamental. An octave is a doubling in frequency.\n",
    "- 1320 is approximately E6, which is a perfect fifth above A5. If you are not familiar with musical intervals like \"perfect fifth”, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(music).\n",
    "- 1760 is A6, two octaves above the fundamental.\n",
    "- 2200 is approximately C♯7, which is a major third above A6.\n",
    "\n",
    "These harmonics make up the notes of an A major chord, although not all in the same octave. Some of them are only approximate because the notes that make up Western music have been adjusted for equal temperament (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the harmonics and their amplitudes, you can reconstruct the signal by adding up sinusoids. Next we’ll see how."

    "freq is frequency in Hz. amp is amplitude in unspecified units where 1.0 is defined as the largest amplitude we can record or play back.\n",
    "\n",

    "Signals have an __add__ method, so you can use the + operator to add them:\n",

    "    mix = sin_sig + cos_sig\n",
    "The result is a SumSignal, which represents the sum of two or more signals.\n",

    "You can’t do much with a Signal until you evaluate it. In this context, “evaluate” means taking a sequence of points in time, ts, and computing the corresponding values of the signal, ys. I represent ts and ys using NumPy arrays and encapsulate them in an object called a Wave.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Wave represents a signal evaluated at a sequence of points in time. Each point in time is called a frame (a term borrowed from movies and video). The measurement itself is called a sample, although “frame” and “sample” are sometimes used interchangeably.\n",

    "    wave = mix.make_wave(duration=0.5, start=0, framerate=11025)\n",
