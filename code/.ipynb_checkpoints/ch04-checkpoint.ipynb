    "# Chapter 4  Noise\n",
    "\n",
    "In English, “noise” means an unwanted or unpleasant sound. In the context of signal processing, it has two different senses:\n",
    "\n",
    "As in English, it can mean an unwanted signal of any kind. If two signals interfere with each other, each signal would consider the other to be noise. “Noise” also refers to a signal that contains components at many frequencies, so it lacks the harmonic structure of the periodic signals we saw in previous chapters.\n",
    "This chapter is about the second kind.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for this chapter is in chap04.ipynb, which is in the repository for this book (see Section 0.2). You can also view it at http://tinyurl.com/thinkdsp04."
