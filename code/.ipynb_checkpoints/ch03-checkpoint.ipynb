    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def evaluate(self, ts):\n",

    "\n",
    "If the length of ts is n, you can think of it as a sequence of n−1 intervals of time. To compute the frequency during each interval, I use np.linspace, which returns a NumPy array of n−1 values between start and end.\n",

    "\n",
    "The reason is that our perception of pitch depends on the logarithm of frequency. As a result, the interval we hear between two notes depends on the ratio of their frequencies, not the difference. “Interval” is the musical term for the perceived difference between two pitches.\n",

    "For example, an octave is an interval where the ratio of two pitches is 2. So the interval from 220 to 440 is one octave and the interval from 440 to 880 is also one octave. The difference in frequency is bigger, but the ratio is the same.\n",

    "As a result, if frequency increases linearly, as in a linear chirp, the perceived pitch increases logarithmically.\n",

    "Exercise 4   In musical terminology, a “glissando” is a note that slides from one pitch to another, so it is similar to a chirp.\n",
    "Find or make a recording of a glissando and plot a spectrogram of the first few seconds. One suggestion: George Gershwin’s Rhapsody in Blue starts with a famous clarinet glissando, which you can download from http://archive.org/details/rhapblue11924.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise 5   A trombone player can play a glissando by extending the trombone slide while blowing continuously. As the slide extends, the total length of the tube gets longer, and the resulting pitch is inversely proportional to length.\n",
    "Assuming that the player moves the slide at a constant speed, how does frequency vary with time?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a class called TromboneGliss that extends Chirp and provides evaluate. Make a wave that simulates a trombone glissando from C3 up to F3 and back down to C3. C3 is 262 Hz; F3 is 349 Hz.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plot a spectrogram of the resulting wave. Is a trombone glissando more like a linear or exponential chirp?\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise 6   Make or find a recording of a series of vowel sounds and look at the spectrogram. Can you identify different vowels?\n",

    "Beginning a method name with an underscore makes it “private”, indicating that it is not part of the API that should be used outside the class definition."
