    "corrs2 = np.correlate(segment.ys, segment.ys, mode='same')\n",
    "The option mode tells correlate what range of lag to use. With the value ’same’, the range is from −N/2 to N/2, where N is the length of the wave array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 5.9 shows the result. It is symmetric because the two signals are identical, so a negative lag on one has the same effect as a positive lag on the other. To compare with the results from autocorr, we can select the second half:\n",
    "\n",
    "    N = len(corrs2)\n",
    "    half = corrs2[N//2:]\n",
    "If you compare Figure 5.9 to Figure 5.8, you’ll notice that the correlations computed by np.correlate get smaller as the lags increase. That’s because np.correlate uses the unstandardized definition of correlation; as the lag gets bigger, the overlap between the two signals gets smaller, so the magnitude of the correlations decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can correct that by dividing through by the lengths:\n",
    "\n",
    "    lengths = range(N, N//2, -1)\n",
    "    half /= lengths\n",
    "Finally, we can standardize the results so the correlation with lag=0 is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "    half /= half[0]\n",
    "With these adjustments, the results computed by autocorr and np.correlate are nearly the same. They still differ by 1-2%. The reason is not important, but if you are curious: autocorr standardizes the correlations independently for each lag; for np.correlate, we standardized them all at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "More importantly, now you know what autocorrelation is, how to use it to estimate the fundamental period of a signal, and two ways to compute it.\n",

    "## 5.7  Exercises\n",
    "Solutions to these exercises are in chap05soln.ipynb.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise 1   The Jupyter notebook for this chapter, chap05.ipynb, includes an interaction that lets you compute autocorrelations for different lags. Use this interaction to estimate the pitch of the vocal chirp for a few different start times.\n",
    "Exercise 2   The example code in chap05.ipynb shows how to use autocorrelation to estimate the fundamental frequency of a periodic signal. Encapsulate this code in a function called estimate_fundamental, and use it to track the pitch of a recorded sound.\n",
    "To see how well it works, try superimposing your pitch estimates on a spectrogram of the recording.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise 3   If you did the exercises in the previous chapter, you downloaded the historical price of BitCoins and estimated the power spectrum of the price changes. Using the same data, compute the autocorrelation of BitCoin prices. Does the autocorrelation function drop off quickly? Is there evidence of periodic behavior?\n",
    "Exercise 4   In the repository for this book you will find a Jupyter notebook called saxophone.ipynb that explores autocorrelation, pitch perception, and a phenomenon called the missing fundamental. Read through this notebook and run the examples. Try selecting a different segment of the recording and running the examples again.\n",
    "Vi Hart has an excellent video called “What is up with Noises? (The Science and Mathematics of Sound, Frequency, and Pitch)”; it demonstrates the missing fundamental phenomenon and explains how pitch perception works (at least, to the degree that we know).
