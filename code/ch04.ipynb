    "As in English, it can mean an unwanted signal of any kind. If two signals interfere with each other, each signal would consider the other to be noise. “Noise” also refers to a signal that contains components at many frequencies, so it lacks the harmonic structure of the periodic signals we saw in previous chapters.\n",
    "This chapter is about the second kind.\n",

    "UG noise is similar in many ways to UU noise. The spectrum has equal power at all frequencies, on average, so UG is also white. And it has one other interesting property: the spectrum of UG noise is also UG noise. More precisely, the real and imaginary parts of the spectrum are uncorrelated Gaussian values.\n",

    "A Geiger counter is a device that detects radiation. When an ionizing particle strikes the detector, it outputs a surge of current. The total output at a point in time can be modeled as uncorrelated Poisson (UP) noise, where each sample is a random quantity from a Poisson distribution, which corresponds to the number of particles detected during an interval.\n",
    "Write a class called UncorrelatedPoissonNoise that inherits from thinkdsp._Noise and provides evaluate. It should use np.random.poisson to generate random values from a Poisson distribution. The parameter of this function, lam, is the average number of particles during each interval. You can use the attribute amp to specify lam. For example, if the frame rate is 10 kHz and amp is 0.001, we expect about 10 “clicks” per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generate about a second of UP noise and listen to it. For low values of amp, like 0.001, it should sound like a Geiger counter. For higher values it should sound like white noise. Compute and plot the power spectrum to see whether it looks like white noise.\n",

    "Exercise 5   \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm in this chapter for generating pink noise is conceptually simple but computationally expensive. There are more efficient alternatives, like the Voss-McCartney algorithm. Research this method, implement it, compute the spectrum of the result, and confirm that it has the desired relationship between power and frequency."
