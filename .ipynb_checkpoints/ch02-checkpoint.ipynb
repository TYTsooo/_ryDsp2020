The fourth peak is at 2300, not 7700 Hz. And if you look closely, the peak that should be at 9900 is actually at 100 Hz. What’s going on?\n",

    "In this example, the highest frequency we can measure is 5000 Hz, which is half the sampling rate. Frequencies above 5000 Hz are folded back below 5000 Hz, which is why this threshold is sometimes called the “folding frequency”. It is sometimes also called the Nyquist frequency. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_frequency.\n",

Folded at 5000 Hz, it would appear at -2100 Hz, but it gets folded again at 0 Hz, back to 2100 Hz. In fact, you can see a small peak at 2100 Hz in Figure 2.4, and the next one at 4300 Hz."

    "\n",
    "np.fft is the NumPy module that provides functions related to the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which is an efficient algorithm that computes the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT).\n",
    "\n",
    "make_spectrum uses rfft, which stands for “real FFT”, because the Wave contains real values, not complex. Later we’ll see the full FFT, which can handle complex signals (see Section 7.9). The result of rfft, which I call hs, is a NumPy array of complex numbers that represents the amplitude and phase offset of each frequency component in the wave.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of rfftfreq, which I call fs, is an array that contains frequencies corresponding to the hs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the values in hs, consider these two ways to think about complex numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "A complex number is the sum of a real part and an imaginary part, often written x + iy, where i is the imaginary unit, √−1. You can think of x and y as Cartesian coordinates.\n",
    "A complex number is also the product of a magnitude and a complex exponential, A ei φ, where A is the magnitude and φ is the angle in radians, also called the “argument”. You can think of A and φ as polar coordinates.\n",
    "Each value in hs corresponds to a frequency component: its magnitude is proportional to the amplitude of the corresponding component; its angle is the phase offset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Spectrum class provides two read-only properties, amps and angles, which return NumPy arrays representing the magnitudes and angles of the hs. When we plot a Spectrum object, we usually plot amps versus fs. Sometimes it is also useful to plot angles versus fs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it might be tempting to look at the real and imaginary parts of hs, you will almost never need to. I encourage you to think of the DFT as a vector of amplitudes and phase offsets that happen to be encoded in the form of complex numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To modify a Spectrum, you can access the hs directly. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "spectrum.hs *= 2\n",
    "spectrum.hs[spectrum.fs > cutoff] = 0\n",
    "The first line multiplies the elements of hs by 2, which doubles the amplitudes of all components. The second line sets to 0 only the elements of hs where the corresponding frequency exceeds some cutoff frequency.\n",

    "spectrum.low_pass(cutoff)\n",
