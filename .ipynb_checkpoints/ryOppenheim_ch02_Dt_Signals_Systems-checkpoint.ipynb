Although sequences do not always arise from sampling analog waveforms, it is convenient to refer to x[n] as the “nth sample” of the sequence. Also, although, strictly speaking, x[n] denotes the nth number in the sequence, the notation of Eq. (2.1) is often unnecessarily cumbersome, and it is convenient and unambiguous to refer to “the sequence x[n]” when we mean the entire sequence, just as we referred to “the analog signal xa(t).” We depict discrete-time signals (i.e., sequences) graphically, as shown in Figure 2.1. Although the abscissa is drawn as a continuous line, it is important to recognize that x[n] is defined only for integer values of n. It is not correct to think of x[n] as being zero when n is not an integer; x[n] is simply undefined for noninteger values of n.\n"
